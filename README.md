# App 2025

Want to see how everyone will build [serverless applications][serverless] on [AWS][aws] in 2025? Want to use those patterns today to gain a competitive advantage?

Come learn how, with App 2025! Every Thursday we'll build a bit of our application live on [Twitch][twitch], so you can see the patterns that will help you get ahead today.

## Past sessions:

### Amazon EventBridge as the backbone of your app

In the [first episode][first-episode] of App 2025, viewers learn a high-level pattern for building serverless applications. A sample use case is presented: an order fulfillment application for AnyCompany , a fictional Software as a Service (SaaS) company. [Amazon EventBridge][eventbridge] is introduced as the backbone of the app. [AWS Step Functions][step-functions] workflows, both standard and express, are introduced for business processes that consume events from EventBridge. Service integrations are introduced for data storage, and [Identity and Access Management (IAM)][iam] considerations are discussed. Monitoring and auditability of events on EventBridge are discussed. Finally, [AWS SAM CLI][sam-cli] is introduced, and a simple template is created with a single resource, a custom EventBridge event bus.

## Upcoming Sessions (subject to change):

* 16 April - [Express Workflows][express-workflows] for quick-running processes
* 23 April - Waiting for human interaction with the [callback pattern][callback-pattern]
* 30 April - Notifying users with [Amazon SNS][sns]
